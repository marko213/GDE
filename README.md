# GDE

GDE (or "Project GDE", "Project: GDE" etc. (GDE is not an abbreviation in this project, just a name)) tries to simulate computer evolution in a simple platformer-like game. It uses "evolving" simple neural networks to do so.


# GDE level editor

GDE level editor (leveleditor) is, as suggested by the name, a level editor for GDE. It enables the user to control the game directly (not trough networks) and to design new levels.
