# GDE

GDE (or "Project GDE", "Project: GDE" etc. (GDE is not an abbreviation in this project, just a name)) tries to simulate computer evolution in a simple platformer-like game. It uses "evolving" simple neural networks to do so.


# GDE level editor

GDE level editor (leveleditor) is, as suggested by the name, a level editor for GDE. It enables the user to control the game directly (not through networks) and to design new levels.

<b><i>Both GDE and the GDE level editor were created with Processing from www.processing.org (<a href="https://github.com/processing/processing">GitHub link</a>)</i></b>
