# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

<b>Please follow the appropiate instructions for your operating system</b>

<b>The binary (built) files can be found in the releases</b>

<b>Note: <i>the releases have both 32-bit and 64-bit releases. If you don't know which one you should use, the 32-bit version should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit computers.</i></b>

<b>FOR MAC OS X USERS: there is no Mac OS X version as of now. Processing 2.2.1 seems to have a bug with exporting an application to OS X. This may be fixed in the future (if the Processing version is updated).</b>

<b>Installation note: executing the main executable file does not (or, at least should not) create any additional files.</b>

TL;DR: download the file you need, extract it and execute the executable file.

<b>Windows</b>

<p>1  Download the matching file for your system (either 64-bit or 32-bit).</p>
<p>2  Extract the files from the .zip file (they should be in a folder named "GDE")</p>
<p>3  Execute the "GDE.exe" file contained in the "GDE" folder</p>

<b>Linux</b>

<p>1  Download the matching file for your system (either 64-bit or 32-bit).</p>
<p>2  Extract the files from the .zip file (they should be in a folder named "GDE").</p>
<p>3a Execute the "GDE" file contained in the "GDE" folder. If this fails, try step 3b before retrying.</p>
<p>3b Set the executable flag for the file (make the file executable). On Ubuntu and similar distributions, tyhis can usually be done by right-clicking the "GDE" file, selecting "Properties" and setting the Execute option (under the "Rights" tab) to something like "Owner only".</p>
