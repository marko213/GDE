BUG LIST (08.03.2017)

Open bugs

Cube colliding with boxes at high vertical speed from the top (near the edge of the box) can cause the cube to die.

A small flash of deactivation can sometimes be seen from box detecting screen nodes (and their output connectors) at the start of a run.

Connectors seem to connect to the bottom output of a node more often, making nodes almost useless.



Fixed bugs

Every screennode (except for box detecting nodes below ground level) will deactivate at the beginning of a run, often making the player jump for no reason. (Fixed on 05.03.2017)
